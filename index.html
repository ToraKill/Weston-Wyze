            Every Wyze camera has many features that help it stay on the cutting edge of security, like the coloured
            night vision in all Wyze cameras, or the two-way audio that can hold a conversation anywhere, with auto
            detection tracking you will feel a lot safer but what takes the cake is it's local storage in all devices
            that even without connection will still record and upload your footage as soon as it recieves a connection.

                The Wyze cam telephoto is one of the more simple cameras Wyze offers and it comes with most features but
                no video only photo recording making it good to monitor entrances and exits

                The Wyze Cam Pan is an amazing camera that is really smart, it follows and tracks movement in it field
                of view but not like cameras do it physically moves to track, then it uploads to the Wyze servers which
                then go to your phone

                The Wyze Cam Battery Pro only comes with one battery unless you order another but it has an extremely
                long battery life and the batteries are rechargeable making this camera quite practical considering it
                comes with no cables it also comes with spotlight and siren features to scare away unwanted guests and
                has radar and PIR motion detection making it one of the most impressive cameras Wyze has if you
                disregard the fact that the charger is sold separate.

                The Outdoor Wyze camera is a Weston&Wyze favorite and we would recommend this device to all customers
                While it has all the features the standard cameras do this camera is built to last, with a 6 month
                battery that is rechargeable by micro usb, it comes with a base station to connect the camera to your
                Wyze app but this camera can withstand winter colds and summer hots, but that's not even the best part
                because if you like to travel this camera has a travel mode to protect your belongings anywhere you
                want.

                The Wyze Doorbell v2 is a nifty device, a lot like a Ring doorbell but it comes with a chime to install
                anywhere to hear your doorbell from wherever, With two way audio for talking from another location or
                privacy and safety and 2k video resolution so you can always answer your door.
